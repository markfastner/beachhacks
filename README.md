# beachhacks
In 2020 i took a part of the poplular hackathon,Beach hacks, hosted by my school, Cal State University Long Beach. In Beachhacks we were put into teams and had to decide on a project to submit. I was on a team with a computer science student from India named Priya and we worked to try to win the best website award. Combining our knowledge on web developement Priya and I went through the process of registering a domain, and writing html code allong with stylng. We ended up being sucessful in our goal of creating a simple website that displayed a message and had background colors that would change when there was a click. The hackathon was a lot of fun and I even learned a few new things in particular regarding registering a domain and how to get your code running under that domain. In the future I want to attend more hackathons and work on a variety of different projects
